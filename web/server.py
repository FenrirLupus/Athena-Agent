"""The Athena HTTP server (FastAPI) — the web door (Workstream 2).

The server loop + message loop live BEHIND this HTTP layer. Everything
enters the FIFO queue and is handled in arrival order (oldest → newest,
no races) — the Operator's ordering guarantee.

Endpoints:
    GET  /              → the GUI (chat workspace first on the navbar)
    GET  /health        → server loop status (gates, scheduler, nurse)
    POST /chat          → enqueue a message → the FIFO worker replies
    GET  /sessions      → session list
    GET  /sessions/{id} → session history (JSONL shape)
    GET  /vault?query=  → retrieval ladder over HTTP
    GET  /logs          → metric log reader
    GET  /tools         → registered tools (for MCP + GUI)
    WS   /ws            → live events (the flow markers over the wire)

The MCP endpoint lives in mcp.py and mounts at /mcp.
