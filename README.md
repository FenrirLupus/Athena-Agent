# Athena-Agent

> Say Hello to Athena! She is an artificial intelligence agent designed to mix
> intelligence with wisdom — learning **by doing** instead of knowing how to
> do.

Athena is a self-hosted, autonomous 24/7 agent. She runs her own architecture,
her own website (GUI), her own CLI, and her own server — built to remember
what matters and learn as she works.

## 🚀 Install

The code lives in `athena-system/`. Athena **always** installs into a fresh
`.athena` folder in *your* home directory (Linux: `~/.athena` · Windows:
`%USERPROFILE%\.athena`).

### Linux Install

> ✱ **Linux is the PRIMARY tested version.**

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FenrirLupus/Athena-Agent/main/athena-system/install.sh)
```

### Windows Install

> ✱ **Windows is the SECONDARY tested version.**

```powershell
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FenrirLupus/Athena-Agent/main/athena-system/install.bat' -OutFile install.bat; .\install.bat"
```

> **Note on testing:** everything here is *vibe coded* — Athena Herself is
> created by a highly efficient and intelligent large language model. Linux is
> the primary, best-tested path; Windows is supported but secondary. If
> something isn't smooth on Windows, Linux is the safer bet.

### After installing

```bash
athena        # the CLI window
athena setup  # configure your provider (bring your own key)
athena web    # the GUI server
```

> Either install method lands the code in `~/.athena/athena-system`, builds the
> virtual environment, and links the `athena` command for you — no manual steps.

## 💬 About

- **A side project** — not intended to be professionally made. Built by someone
  artistic in nature with (until Athena) little coding experience.
- **Vibe coded** — created with a highly intelligent yet highly efficient LLM.
- **A bee hive in spirit** — a Queen Bee delegates to Worker Bees, who delegate
  to Drones, all flowing from the Queen's demands.
- **Sold as-is** — no warranty or promises. This repo is where Athena's
  architecture lives and grows over time.
